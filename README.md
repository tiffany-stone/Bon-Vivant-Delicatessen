Marketing Analysis objective to develop a Bon Vivant Delicatessen customer profile

Bon Vivant wants to improve the performance of their marketing activities, with a special focus on marketing campaigns. The objective is to develop a BVD customer profile to target only those customers who would be receptive to future offerings while leaving out the non-respondents.

An initial 5-part promotional campaign involving 2,240 customers was carried out.
Customers were selected at random and contacted by phone.
During those months, socio-economic and firmographic data were collected to develop the Bon Vivant Delicatessen customer profile.
